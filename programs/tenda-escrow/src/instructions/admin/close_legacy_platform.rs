/// who signs. The program has no realloc path for the platform account, so
/// the length cannot be forged. On a fresh deployment (mainnet) this
/// instruction is a permanent no-op: the PDA either doesn't exist or is
/// current-layout.

/// Permissionless by design: the legacy account predates the current admin
/// config, so there is no on-chain authority to anchor a signer check to.
/// Closing it only ever unblocks `initialize_platform`; reclaimed rent
/// goes to whoever paid the tx fee.
