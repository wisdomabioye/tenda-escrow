//! - `accept` / `decline` / `submit` move state only (no funds).
//! - `approve` / `claim_stalled` settle to counterparty with platform fee.
//! - `reclaim` refunds creator (counterparty ghosted past grace).
//!
//! Settlement instructions split SOL vs. SPL into separate handlers so each
//! can use a tight `#[derive(Accounts)]` matching the asset class.
